Index of datasets for Math 3823, last updated 26 January 2016

Naming convention: The name of each dataset  ends in .txt since it is just a
text file.  Note that the first line of the dataset contains the names
of the variables (and so should be read into R using the command
"read.table" with the option "header=T").  For example here are the first
few lines of birthwt.txt

sex age weight
1 40 2968
1 38 2795
1 40 3163
