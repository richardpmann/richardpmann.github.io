Addendum to "Additional component the practical" on Handout 4 for Level 5.

1. The version of R on the computer clusters seems to have a problem
with the library "mgcv".  If, in R, the command

library(mgcv)

does not work, then issue the following command in R (once only)

install.packages("n:/lucs-h13/userlib/userlib/stalib3/rlib/3.1/mgcv_1.8-12.zip",repos=NULL,contriburl=NULL)

You may be asked two questions about creating a personal library --- answer 
yes to both questions.

Now the library(mgcv) command should work.

2. After fitting a generalized additive model and storing the fitted model
in "out", say, the information in out$sp takes two forms:

a. If the value of the smoothing parameter sp is specified in the
generalized additive model (as it is in the bottom half of page 2 in
the handout with sp=1), then out$sp contains no useful information.

b. If the value of sp is not specified in the generalized additive
model, then out$sp contains the value of the smoothing parameter.
