The depth \\(y\\) at location \\(x=6\\) is missing: could we estimate it?\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Coal-seam depths (in metres) below the land surface at intervals of 1 km along a linear transect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation, \\(x\\)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n\nDepth, \\(y\\)\n-90\n-95\n-140\n-120\n-100\n-75\nNA\n-130\n-110\n-105\n-50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1 plots these data, superimposed with predictions from several polynomial regression models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Constant model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Linear model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Quadratic model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Cubic model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: The coal-seam data superimposed with predictions from polynomial regression models.\n\n\n\n\nEach of these models would predict a different value for the missing observation \\(y_6.\\) We do not know the accuracy of the depth measurements, so in principle any of these curves could be correct. Clearly, the residual variance is largest for the constant-depth model in Figure 1.1 (a), and smallest for the cubic polynomial in Figure 1.1 (c) – the residual sums of squares are: 6252.5, 5773.05, 4489.84, 4242.89. However, none of these models produces a convincingly good fit. Moreover, these models are not particularly believable, since we know that geological pressures exerted over very long periods of time cause the landscape and its underlying layers of rock to undulate and fracture. This suggests we need a different strategy.\nNext, consider the simulated example in Figure 1.2. At first look we might be happy with the fitted curves in Figure 1.2 (a) or Figure 1.2 (b). The data, however, are created with a change-point at \\(x=0.67\\) where the relationship changes from linear with slope \\(0.6\\) to a constant value of \\(0.75\\). This description is completely lost with these two models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Linear model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Quadratic model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Piecewise linear model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Cubic smoothing spline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Simulated data superimposed with predictions from various models.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2 (c) shows the result of fitting one linear function to the data below \\(0.67\\) and a second linear function above. Clearly, this fits well but it has assumed that the change-point location is known – which is unrealistic. Finally, Figure 1.2 (d) shows a fitted cubic smoothing spline to the data – we will studies these models later. This shows an excellent fit and leads to appropriate conclusions. That is, the relationship is approximately linear for small values, then there is a rapid increase, and finally a near constant value for high values. Of course, this is not exactly as the true relationship with a discontinuity at \\(x=0.67\\) but it would definitely suggest something extreme occurs between about \\(0.6\\) to \\(0.7\\). Full details will follow later, but the cubic spline fits local cubic polynomials which are constrained to create a continuous curve.\nNow returning to the coal seam data. Figure 1.3 shows the data again, superimposed with predictions from methods which are not constrained to produce such smooth curves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Constant interpolating spline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Linear interpolating spline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Cubic interpolating spline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Cubic smoothing spline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: The coal-seam data superimposed with predictions from various spline models.\n\n\n\n\nThe simplest method, constant-spline interpolation, assumes that the dependent variable remains constant between successive observations, with the result shown in Figure 1.3 (a). However, the discontinuities in this model make it quite unreliable. A better method, whose results are shown in Figure 1.3 (b), is linear-spline interpolation, which fits a straight line between successive observations. Even so, this method produces discontinuities in the gradient at each data point. A better method still, shown in Figure 1.3 (c), is cubic spline interpolation, which fits a cubic polynomial between successive data points such that both the gradient and the curvature at each data point is continuous.\nA feature of all these interpolation methods is that they fit the data exactly. Is this a good thing? The final method assumes that there may be some measurement error in the observations, which justifies fitting a smoother cubic spline than the cubic interpolating spline, but as we see in Figure 1.3 (d) which does not reproduce the data points exactly. Is this a bad thing? We will see during this module how to construct and evaluate these curves. Here, the results are presented only for motivation.",

    "text": "1.3 General modelling approaches\nWe wish to model the dependence of a response variable \\(y\\) on an explanatory variable \\(x\\), where \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) are both continuous. We observe \\(y_i\\) at each time \\(x_i,\\) for \\(i=1,\\ldots, n\\), where the observation locations are ordered: \\(x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; \\ldots &lt;x_n\\). We imagine that the \\(y\\)’s are noisy versions of a smooth function of \\(x\\), say \\(f(x)\\). That is, \\[\ny_i = f(x_i) + \\epsilon_i,\n\\tag{1.1}\\] where the \\(\\{\\epsilon_i\\}\\) are i.i.d: \\[\n\\epsilon_i \\sim \\mathrm{N}(0,\\sigma^2).\n\\tag{1.2}\\] We suppose we do not know the correct form of function \\(f\\): how can we estimate it?\nIt is useful to divide modelling approaches into two broad types: parametric and non-parametric.\n\nParametric models\nBy far the most common parametric model is simple linear regression, for example, \\(f(x) = \\alpha + \\beta x\\), where parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are to be estimated. This is, of course, the simplest example of the polynomial model family, \\(f(x) = \\alpha + \\beta x + \\gamma x^2 +\\cdots + \\omega \\; x^p\\), where \\(p\\) is the order of the polynomial and where all of \\(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\dots, \\omega\\) are to be estimated. This has as special cases: quadratic, cubic, quartic, and quintic polynomials models. Also common are exponential models, for example \\(f(x) = \\alpha e^{-\\beta x}\\), where \\(\\alpha,\\beta\\) are to be estimated – do not confuse this with the exponential probability density function.\nNote that the polynomial models are all linear functions of the parameters. They are standard forms in regression modelling, as studied in MATH3714 (Linear regression and Robustness) and MATH3823 (Generalised linear models). The exponential model, however, is an example of a model which is non-linearly in the parameters – it is an example of a non-linear regression model.\nAlthough very many parametric models exist, they are all somewhat inflexible in their description of \\(f\\). They cannot accommodate arbitrary fluctuations in \\(f(x)\\) over \\(x\\) because they contain only a small number of parameters (degrees-of-freedom).\n\n\nNon-parametric models\nIn such models, \\(f\\) is assumed to be a smooth function of \\(x\\), but otherwise we do not know what \\(f\\) looks like. A smooth function \\(f\\) is such that \\(f(x_i)\\) is close to \\(f(x_j)\\) whenever \\(x_i\\) is close to \\(x_j\\). To characterise and fit \\(f\\) we will use an approach based on splines. In practice, different approaches to characterizing and fitting smooth \\(f\\) lead to similar fits to the data. The spline approach fits neatly with normal and generalised linear models (NLMs and GLMs), but so do other approaches (for example, kernel smoothing and wavelets). Methods of fitting \\(f\\) based on kernel smoothing and the Nadaraya–Watson estimator are studied in the Level 5 component of MATH5714 (Linear regression, robustness and smoothing) where the choice of bandwidth in kernel methods is analogous to the choice of smoothing parameter value in spline smoothing.\n\n\nPiecewise polynomial models\nA common problem with low-order polynomials is that they can often fit well for part of the data but have unappealing features elsewhere. For example, although none of the models in Figure 1.1 fit the data at all well, we might imagine that three short linear segments might be a good fit to the coal-seam data. Also, the piecewise linear model was a good description of the data in Figure 1.2 (c). This suggests that local polynomial models might be useful. In some situation, for example when we know that the function \\(f\\) is continuous, jumps in the fitted model, as in Figure 1.2 (c), are unacceptable. Alternatively, we may require differentiability of \\(f\\). Such technical issues lead to the use of splines, which is introduced in the next chapter.",

    "text": "2.2 Imposing smoothness\nBecause of the use of polynomials, \\(f\\) is smooth between each successive pair of knots. At the knots, however, \\(f\\) might not be continuous and it might not be differentiable – in such cases we would say that the function is not smooth.\nTo ensure that \\(f\\) is also smooth at each of the knots, we impose smoothness constraints which control continuity of the function and its derivatives at the knots.\nLet \\(f^{(\\ell)}\\) be the \\(\\ell\\)-th order derivative, with \\(f^{(0)}=f\\) being the function itself, \\(f^{(1)}=f'\\) is the first derivative and \\(f^{(2)}=f''\\) the second derivative. Further, let \\(f^{(\\ell)}(t-\\epsilon)\\) and \\(f^{(\\ell)}(t+\\epsilon)\\), for \\(\\epsilon\\ge 0\\), denote evaluation of the function or its derivative at points just below and just above \\(t\\) – we will be interested in their relative values as \\(\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0\\).\nTo impose smoothness, we require that\n\\[\n\\lim _{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0} f^{(\\ell)}(t_k-\\epsilon)\n=\n\\lim _{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0} f^{(\\ell)}(t_k+\\epsilon),\n\\tag{2.2}\\] for all \\(k=1,\\ldots,m\\) and for \\(\\ell = 0,\\ldots,(p-1)\\).\nIn other words we say that \\(f\\) is smooth if the limits, from below and from above, of the function and its \\((p-1)\\) derivatives exist and are equal.\nThe meaning of these smoothness constraints is illustrated in Figure 2.2. In Figure 2.2 (a), a piecewise cubic function with two knots has been plotted. The first derivative, \\(f'\\), is discontinuous at the first knot and the function itself, \\(f\\), is discontinuous at the second knot. Figure 2.2 (b) shows a similar shaped cubic spline with two knots. This time, the function \\(f\\) and its first two derivatives are continuous at both knots.\nThe smoothness conditions in Equation 2.2 induce constraints on the coefficients \\(\\{a_{k\\ell}\\}\\). A polynomial of order \\(p\\) has \\(p+1\\) coefficients, and there are \\(m+1\\) intervals when we have \\(m\\) knots. This leads to \\((p+1)\\times(m+1)\\) coefficients but there are \\(p\\) constraints at each of the \\(m\\) knots. Thus the total degrees of freedom of the system is \\[\n\\text{df}_{\\text{spline}}   = (p+1)(m+1) - pm = m+p+1.\n\\tag{2.3}\\]\nThese degrees of freedom provide the necessary flexibility in the spline.\nNote that \\(f\\) is infinitely differentiable everywhere, except at the knots where it is \\(p-1\\) times differentiable. In particular, for \\(p=1\\), \\(f\\) is a linear spline comprising linear pieces constrained to be continuous at the knots, although the slope of \\(f\\) is discontinuous at the knots. Also, for \\(p=3\\), \\(f\\) is a cubic spline comprising cubic polynomial pieces continuous at the knots; where the first and second derivatives of \\(f\\) are also continuous, but the third derivative is discontinuous at the knots.",

    "text": "3.1 Overview\nChapter 1 considered general limitations of parametric models, and polynomial regression in particular (see Figure 1.1), which motivated the use of the more flexible spline models (see Figure 1.3) – though at that stage no mathematical details were presented. In Chapter 2, basic spline definitions were given, including the notation of smoothness constraints, and these ideas were further explored in the Exercises in Section 3.6. This chapter will now give mathematical details of the interpolating spline problem and consider application to data. A feature of all these interpolation methods is that they fit the data exactly and that the fitted functions are smooth. Figure 3.1, is cubic spline interpolation, which fits a cubic polynomial between successive data points such that the function, gradient and the curvature are all continuous at each data point. The solid line shows the fitted values within the range of the data, whereas the dashed line shows the fitted values outside the range of the data – extrapolation.\n\n\nCode\npar(mar=c(3,3,1,1), mgp=c(2,1,0))\n\nlocation=0:10\ndepth=c(-90,-95,-140,-120,-100,-75,NA,-130,-110,-105,-50)\n\nplot(location, depth, \n     xlim=c(-0.5,10.5), ylim=c(-150,0), pch=4)\n\nmysplinefit = splinefun(location, depth, method=\"natural\")\ncurve(mysplinefit,-0.75,10.5, add=T, lty=2)\ncurve(mysplinefit,   0,   10, add=T)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: A cubic interpolating spline fitted to the coal-seam data, with the dashed line showing extrapolation."

    "text": "3.4 Roughness penalties\nAn aim of spline models is to describe an unknown function using piecewise-polynomials which are smooth. In the previous section, smoothness was imposed by explicitly constraining specified high-order derivatives. An alternative approach is to measure and control the degree of smoothness of the splines. In practice the roughness of the spline is usually measured and one definition of roughness is: \\[\nJ_\\nu(f) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\left[ f^{(\\nu)}(t) \\right]^2 \\text{d}t\n\\tag{3.8}\\] where \\(\\nu\\geq 1\\) is an integer and \\(f^{(\\nu)}\\) denotes the \\(\\nu\\)th derivative of \\(f\\). Thus \\(f^{(1)}(t)\\) denotes the first derivative and \\(f^{(2)}(t)\\) denotes the second derivative of \\(f\\).\nIntuitively, roughness measures the “wiggliness” of a function.\nAim might be to find the smoothest function which interpolates the data points. Hence, an alternative approach to that in previous sections is to find the function \\(f\\) which minimizes Equation 3.8 and satisfies \\(f(t_i)=y_i\\) for \\(i=1,\\dots,m\\). We refer to the solutions of this problem as the optimal interpolating function.\nIt turns out that there is a very close link between \\(J_\\nu(\\cdot)\\) and \\(p\\)th-order natural splines, where \\(p=2\\nu-1\\) (so \\(p\\) is odd). Important special cases are: \\(\\nu=1\\) and \\(p=1\\), and \\(\\nu=2\\) and \\(p=3\\). This relationship is defined in the following proposition.\n\nProposition 3.2 The optimal interpolating function is a \\(p\\)th-order natural spline, where \\(p = 2ν − 1\\). That is, the natural spline \\(f\\) is the unique minimizer of \\(J_\\nu(f)\\).\n\nProof: Not covered here (but may be included later in the module if time allows).\nComments\n\nLinear and cubic interpolating splines are also of interest in numerical analysis, for example to interpolate tables of numbers.\nThe linear interpolating spline is simply the piecewise-linear path connecting the data points.\nOf course, in the linear spline case, knot points are clearly visible as kinks in the interpolating function. But, in the cubic spline case, knots points are invisible to the naked eye. Hence, in general, there is little motivation to use higher-order splines.\nNumerical considerations: the interpolating spline solutions involve matrix inversion. The inversion of an \\(n \\times n\\) matrix involves \\(O(n^3)\\) operations – hence it is time consuming if \\(n\\) is large (for example, \\(n=1000\\) or \\(10000\\)). Fortunately there are tricks to reduce the computation to \\(O(n)\\).",

Then, \\(\\hat{f}\\) solves the interpolation problem for the artificial data set \\((x_i,\\hat{y}_i), i=1,\\dots , n\\). That is, \\(\\hat{f}\\) minimizes \\(J_\\nu(f)\\) over functions \\(f\\) satisfying \\(\\hat f(x_i)=\\hat{y}_i\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\). Consequently, \\(\\hat{f}\\) is a \\(p^{\\text{th}}\\)-order natural spline, where \\(p=2\\nu-1\\). This means that, when solving the smoothing problem, we only need consider spline functions given by the representations in Proposition 3.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Smoothing spline of data shown as dots and with fitted values shown as crosses\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Interpolating spline of fitted values from smoothing problem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Illustration of proposition showing that solution of the smothing problem is a natural interpolating spline.\n\n\n\nProof: Suppose the assertion is not true. In this case, we must be able to find a function \\({\\hat{f}^\\star}\\), say, which also interpolates the artificial data \\((x_i,\\hat{y}_i), i=1,\\dots ,n\\), but which has a smaller roughness penalty. That is \\[\nJ_\\nu({\\hat{f}^\\star}) &lt; J_\\nu(\\hat{f})\n  \\mbox{ with }\n\\hat{f}^\\star(x_i) = \\hat{y}_i, \\ i=1,\\ldots,n.\n\\] Note that the fitted values from the function \\(\\hat f^\\star\\) are also equal to \\(\\hat y_i, i=1,\\dots,n\\) as it interpolates the same artificial data as \\(\\hat f\\).\nNow, from Equation 4.2, \\[\\begin{align*}\n  R_\\nu(\\hat{f}^\\star, \\lambda) &= \\sum_i (y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2 + \\lambda J_\\nu(\\hat{f}^\\star)\\\\\n&&lt; \\sum_i (y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2 + \\lambda J_\\nu(\\hat{f})\n= R_\\nu(\\hat{f}, \\lambda).\n\\end{align*}\\] Hence \\(R_\\nu(\\hat{f}^\\star, \\lambda) &lt; R_\\nu(\\hat{f}, \\lambda)\\). But, by construction \\(\\hat{f}\\) minimizes \\(R_\\nu(f, \\lambda),\\) which is a contradiction. Hence, it must not be possible to find a function \\({\\hat{f}^\\star}\\) which also interpolates the artificial data but which has a smaller roughness penalty.\nWe have shown that \\(\\hat{f}\\) is the optimal interpolant of the fitted values \\(\\hat{y}_i,\\ i=1,\\dots,n,\\) so it follows from Proposition 4.1 that \\(\\hat{f}\\) is a natural spline of order \\(p=2\\nu-1\\).",

How can we capture this notion precisely?\nA clue comes from Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, in which the fitted values are given by \\[\n\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = X (X^T X)^{-1} X^T \\mathbf{y} = H \\mathbf{y},\n\\] where \\(X\\) is the \\(n \\times p\\) design matrix, where \\(p\\) is the number of model parameters. Here, \\[\nH = X (X^T X)^{-1} X^T\n\\] is called the hat matrix, which linearly maps the data \\(\\mathbf y\\) onto the fitted values \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\). Using the property that \\(\\text{trace}(QR) = \\text{trace}(RQ)\\) for matrices \\(Q,R\\) of conformable dimensions, the trace of the hat matrix is: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\text{trace}(X(X^T X)^{-1} X^T) &= \\text{trace}((X^T X)^{-1} X^T X)\\\\\n&= \\text{trace}(I_p)\\\\\n&= p,\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\(I_p\\) is the \\(p \\times p\\) identity matrix. Thus, for OLS regression, we see that the trace of the hat matrix equals the number of model parameters.\nNow in Equation 5.4 we see that the smoothing matrix \\(S_\\lambda\\) takes the role of a hat matrix, since it linearly maps the data onto the fitted values. This suggests that, for the smoothing spline, we can calculate an effective number of degrees of freedom as: \\[\n\\text{edf}_\\lambda = \\text{trace} \\, S_\\lambda.\n\\tag{5.5}\\] It can be shown from the limiting behaviour of the smoothing splines as \\(\\lambda \\rightarrow \\infty\\) and \\(\\lambda \\rightarrow 0\\) that \\(\\text{edf}_\\infty = \\nu\\) (the number of parameters in the OLS solution) and \\(\\text{edf}_0 = n\\) (the number of parameters in the interpolating spline)."

    "text": "5.6 Generalised Cross Validation\nThe cross-validation criterion \\(Q_{OCV}(\\lambda)\\), defined in Equation 5.2, is used to set the smoothing parameter, \\(\\lambda\\). However, as noted in Section 5.3, using Equation 5.2 to compute \\(Q_{OCV}(\\lambda)\\) would be impractical for large \\(n,\\) since it would require fitting a new smoothing spline \\(\\hat{f}_{\\lambda,-j}\\) for each leave-one-out dataset \\(I_{-j}\\).\nFortunately, it is possible to compute \\(Q_{OCV}(\\lambda)\\) directly from the spline \\(\\hat{f}_{\\lambda}\\) fitted to the full dataset. It can be shown that Equation 5.2 can be rewritten: \\[\nQ_{OCV}(\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left(\\frac{y_j - \\hat{f}_{\\lambda}(t_j)}{1-s_{jj}}\\right)^2,\n\\tag{5.6}\\] where \\(\\hat{f}_{\\lambda}(t_j)\\) is the full-data fitted spline value at \\(t_j\\) given by Equation 5.4, and \\(s_{jj}\\) is the \\(j\\)th diagonal element of the smoothing (hat) matrix \\(S_\\lambda\\).\nPrior to the discovery of algorithm to compute Equation 5.6 quickly, a computationally efficient approximation to the cross-validation criterion Equation 5.2 was proposed, called the Generalised Cross-Validation criterion (GCV): \\[\nQ_{GCV}(\\lambda) = \\frac{ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^n \\left(y_j - \\hat{f}_{\\lambda}(t_j)\\right)^2}{\\left(1-\\tfrac{1}{n}\\text{trace}(S_\\lambda)\\right)^2}.\n\\tag{5.7}\\] Thus Equation 5.7 replaces \\(s_{jj}\\) in Equation 5.6 with the average of the diagonal elements of \\(S_\\lambda\\), which equals \\(\\tfrac{1}{n}\\text{edf}_\\lambda\\). Thus a low value of \\(\\text{edf}_\\lambda\\) will deflate \\(Q_{GCV}(\\lambda)\\), making that value of \\(\\lambda\\) more favourable.\nIn principle, OCV supplants GCV, but GCV is still used as it is numerically more stable. In particular, GCV is used in the \\(\\texttt{mgcv}\\) package – this will be discussed in the next chapter."

    "text": "6.3 GAMs in R\nFitting smoothing splines is straightforward in practice using R. At the beginning of each R session, the first step is to load the package \\(\\texttt{mgcv}\\) which makes available a set of routines written by Simon Wood of the University of Bath.\nThe main command is \\(\\texttt{gam}\\) which fits a smoothing spline (or, more generally, a general additive model). The \\(\\texttt{gam}\\) function is an extension to the \\(\\texttt{glm}\\) command for fitting generalised linear models, to allow nonparametric functions of explanatory variables.\nThe syntax of the \\(\\texttt{gam}\\) command is similar to that of \\(\\texttt{glm}\\). Suppose \\(\\texttt{y}\\) is a vector of length containing observations of a dependent variable and is another vector of length containing the times of those observations. Then each of the commands\n\n\nCode\nout=gam(y~s(tt,fx=FALSE,k=6,sp=3.5))\nout=gam(y~s(tt,fx=FALSE,k=6))\n\n\nfits a cubic smoothing spline to the dependent variable \\(\\texttt{y}\\). In the first version above, the user explicitly sets the smoothing parameter \\(\\lambda\\) (here denoted \\(\\texttt{sp}\\)) to the value \\(3.5\\). In the second version, the optimal value of \\(\\lambda\\) is chosen by the routine to minimise the Generalised Cross-Validation criterion, GCV. The notation \\(\\texttt{s(tt)}\\) means a smooth function (a cubic smoothing spline in this setting) of the explanatory variable \\(\\texttt{tt}\\). This notation can be viewed as an extension of the model notation used by the \\(\\texttt{glm}\\) function. Setting \\(\\texttt{fx=FALSE}\\) in function \\(\\texttt{s}\\) specifies that the dimensionality of the spline should be free (see later notes). Parameter \\(\\texttt{k}\\) of function \\(\\texttt{s}\\) specifies the maximum dimensionality of the spline, and should be set according to the problem and data at hand since the default value will not be appropriate in general. For example, if \\(\\texttt{tt}\\) contains only 6 distinct values, then it would be appropriate to set \\(\\texttt{k=6}\\).\nIn each of the above examples, output from \\(\\texttt{gam}\\) is stored in an object called \\(\\texttt{out}\\). This object contains several components of interest:\n\n\\(\\texttt{out\\$fitted.values}\\) is a vector of length \\(\\texttt{n}\\) containing the fitted values of the smoothing spline at the data values.\n\\(\\texttt{out\\$gcv.ubre}\\) contains the value of the GCV criterion.\n\\(\\texttt{out\\$hat}\\) contains the diagonal values of the smoothing matrix, also called the hat matrix. The total degrees of freedom in the model (including the intercept term) is given by \\(\\texttt{sum(out\\$hat)}\\).\n\\(\\texttt{out\\$sp}\\) contains the smoothing parameter value.\n\\(\\texttt{summary.gam(out)}\\) provides a summary of the smoothed model fit.\n\\(\\texttt{anova.gam(out)}\\) provides an analysis of deviance for the model.\n\nThus, if \\(\\texttt{gam}\\) is called without an explicit choice of \\(\\texttt{sp}\\) (as in the second example above), the output from \\(\\texttt{gam}\\) gives the optimal smoothing parameter value and the corresponding value of the GCV criterion.\nTo plot a smoothing spline:\n\ndefine a dense set of times spanning the data, at which to plot the smooth curve;\nuse the \\(\\texttt{predict.gam}\\) function to compute the cubic spline at these values.\n\nFor example, suppose \\(\\texttt{y}\\) is a vector of length 20 containing the responses at times \\(1,\\dots,20\\).\n\n\nCode\n# observation times\ntt=1:20\n# compute a dense set of numbers between 0 and 21: 0,0.1,...,20.9,21.0\nttnew = (0:210)/10\n# compute predicted values at each of 0,0.1,...,20.9,21.0\npred=predict.gam(out,newdata=list(tt=ttnew))\n# plot the original data\nplot(tt,y)\n# superimpose the smoothing spline\nlines(ttnew,pred)"

See Section Section 5.5 for further details on the calculation of edf.\nThe significance of each of these smooth terms is given by the \\(p\\)-value column in the above table. These \\(p\\)-values are computed from the \\(\\chi^2\\) statistics in the previous column whose approximate degrees of freedom are given in the column headed \\(\\texttt{Ref.df}\\). For example, the \\(p\\)-value of 0.0196 for \\(\\texttt{s(tobacco)}\\) is computed by referring 17.62 to the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution on 7.573 degrees of freedom. Note that this compares the above model with the model which omits \\(\\texttt{tobacco}\\) completely.\nThe following R code was used to plot the fitted smooth functions of age and tobacco consumption:\n\n\nCode\n# for larger axis labels\npar(cex.lab=1.6)\n# create synthetic data set for ages 15 to 65 having consumed\n# no tobacco and with no family history of heart disease\nnewdat1 = data.frame(age = seq(from=15,to=65,by=0.1),tobacco=0,\n          famhist=\"Absent\")\n# predict logit probability of CHD in these synthetic individuals\npred1 = predict.gam(gam1,newdata=newdat1)\n# plot the predicted logit probability of CHD by age in these\n# synthetic individuals\nplot(newdat1$age,pred1,xlab=\"Age\",\n    ylab=\"Predicted logit probability of CHD\", type=\"l\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# create synthetic data set for age 40 having consumed tobacco\n# ranging from 0 to 32kg and with no family history  of heart disease\nnewdat2 = data.frame(age = 40,tobacco=seq(from=0,to=32,by=0.1),\n          famhist=\"Absent\")\n# predict logit probability of CHD in these synthetic individuals\npred2 = predict.gam(gam1,newdata=newdat2)\n# plot the predicted logit probability of CHD by tobacco in these imaginary individuals\nplot(newdat2$tobacco,pred2,xlab=\"Tobacco consumption\",\n    ylab=\"logit probability of CHD\", type=\"l\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe predicted dependence of the logit probability of CHD on smooth functions of age and tobacco consumption is shown above. We see an almost linear predicted age-dependence, in agreement with its edf. The curious predicted dependence on tobacco consumption might be explained by other factors correlated with tobacco consumption."

    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nIn the Level 3 component of this module, we extend the simple linear regression model to the generalised linear model which can cope with non-normally distributed response variables, in particular data following binomial and Poisson distributions. However, we still just use linear functions of the predictor variables. A further extension of the linear model is the generalised additive model. Here, we no longer insist on the predictor variables affecting the response via a linear function of the predictors, but allow the response to depend on a more general smooth function of the predictor. In the Level 5 component of this module, we study splines and their use in interpolating and smoothing the effects of explanatory variables in the generalised linear models of the Level 3 component of this module (see separate Lecture Notes accompanying MATH3823). Towards the end of the material, we will learn that the fitting of generalised additive models is a straightforward extension of what is learnt in MATH3823.\nOutline of the additional material in MATH5824 compared to MATH3823:",

    "text": "2.1 Basic definitions\nLet \\(t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; \\ldots &lt; t_m\\) be a fixed set of sites or knots which need not correspond to observation locations, as in Figure 2.1.\nFigure 2.1: Diagram of knots and data points.\nNote that we use the symbol \\(t\\), rather than \\(x\\), so that we do not confuse knots and observation locations.\nA spline of order \\(p\\geq 1\\) is a piecewise-polynomial of order \\(p\\) which is \\((p-1)\\) times differentiable at the knots. Thus there are coefficients \\(\\{a_{k\\ell},\\; k=0,\\ldots,m, \\; \\ell=0,\\ldots,p\\}\\) such that \\[\nf(t) = \\sum_{\\ell=0}^p a_{k\\ell} \\; t^\\ell,\\qquad \\text{for}~t_k \\leq t &lt;t_{k+1},\n\\tag{2.1}\\] where we take \\(t_0 = -\\infty\\) and \\(t_{m+1} = +\\infty\\).\nIf we are using cubic polynomials, (\\(p=3\\)), then \\(f\\) is given by the following equations: \\[\nf(t) = a_{00} + a_{01} t + a_{02}t^2 +a_{03}t^3, \\quad\nt_0 \\le t &lt; t_1\n\\] to the left of the first knot, \\[\nf(t) = a_{10} + a_{11} t + a_{12}t^2 +a_{13}t^3, \\quad\nt_1 \\le t &lt; t_2\n\\] between the first and second knots, and so on until \\[\nf(t) = a_{m0} + a_{m1} t + a_{m2}t^2 +a_{m3}t^3, \\quad\nt_m \\le t &lt; t_{m+1}\n\\] to the right of the final knot. This is illustrated in Figure 2.2 (a) with \\(m=2.\\)",
